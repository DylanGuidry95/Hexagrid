# Hexagrid!
Hexagrid is a template project that I plan to use to make a turn-based game with.
As of now, it's just a collection of scripts and assets that make working with a hexagon grid system easier.

## Current features in Hexagrid!
* Generating a grid of hexagons
* Hexes can find thier neighbors
* Pathing with A* and TwinStarÂ©
* Basic fog of war
