<h1>Hexagrid</h1>

Hexagrid is a template project that I plan to use to make a turn-based game with.
As of now, it's just a collection of scripts and assets that make working with a hexagon grid system easier.
Things like; generating a grid of hexagons, hexes being able to find thier neighbors, and pathing on a hexagon map.
